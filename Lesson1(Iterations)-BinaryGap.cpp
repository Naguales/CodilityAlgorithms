// 1. BinaryGap.

/**
 * A binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros
 * that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of N.
 * 
 * Write a function:
 *      class Solution { public int solution(int N); }
 * that, given a positive integer N, returns the length of its longest binary gap.
 * The function should return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.
 * 
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 *      â€¢ N is an integer within the range [1..2,147,483,647].
